    How are you supposed

    Appendixes, I've read 'em,
    didn't mention this at all!

    A complex world  
    How the fuck should this be graphed?  
    When all that I underline, and read online,  
    is lost after the exam  
    What will I do?  
    And this is only chapter two...  
    Starting to realise, that I despise,  
    those who told me I need to take this course  

    I can parameterise it... 

    I can help you with C 
    Imaginary exponents  
    Unforgettable moments
    when we study side by side  


    The end's in sight!  
    Just like your mother's was last night
    My studies are organised, prioritised,  
    I stopped procrastinating  
    I've become versed!  
    In solving tortuous PDEs  
    I'm finally safe and sound, a key I found,  
    it laid there in a whole new world: Laplace!

    From a young age, he was an odd one  
    When others played war, he would rest  
    But when his best friend, Sven, was wounded  
    Jesus was with him to resurrect  

    Jesus's with us, he lives in Skövde....  

    He went to high school, like all the others  
    He was outstanding, at PE  
    Oh what a great lad, he walked on water
    One time he trekked down, to Miami  

    Jesus's with us, he lives in Skövde....

    During his teen years, he was a loved one
    He got invited, to every feast
    Oh what a great lad, he could turn water

    Godiva was a lady who through Coventry did ride,
    to show the royal villagers her fine and pure white hide
    The most observant man of all, an engineer of course,
    was the only one who noticed that Godiva rode a horse
    
    We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the Engineers
    We can, we can, we can, we can, demolish forty beers
    Drink rum, drink rum, drink rum all day, and come along with us
    'Cause we don't give a damn for any old man who don't give a damn for us!
    
    She said, I've come a long, long way, and I will go as far,
    with the man who takes me from this horse and leads me to a bar
    The men who took her from her steed and led her to a beer,
    were a bleary-eyed surveyor and a drunken engineer
    
    Caesar set out for Egypt at the age of fifty-three,
    but Cleopatra's blood was warm, her heart was young and free
    And every night when Julius said good-night at three o'clock,
    a Roman Engineer was waiting just around the block!

    The Army and the Navy went out to have some fun
    They went down to the taverns where the fiery liquors run,
    but all they found were empties for the Engineers had come
    and traded all their instruments for gallon kegs of rum

    An artsman and an Engineer once found a gallon can
    Said the artsman: “Match me drink for drink, let's see if you're a man”
    They drank three drinks, the artsman fell, his face was turning green
    But the Engineer drank on and said, "It's only gasoline!"

    An Engineer once came to class drunk and very late
    He was carrying a load that you'd expect to ship by freight
    In fact, the only things there were that kept him on his course
    Were the boundary conditions and the Coriolis force

    A physics man from M.I.T. went out and drank his fill
    and then came to a strip joint 'cause he had some time to kill
    The motions that he witnessed there excited all his nerves
    and he filled eleven napkins with equations of the curves

    3.141 is pi, and 2.7's e
    The root of -1 is i, the speed of light is c
    And I can rattle off these numbers 'til infinity,
    but the only thing that's constant is the work at MIT!

    A man sat in a tavern with a lovely looking lass
    and stared, when for the nineteenth time she raised and drained her glass

    but the maiden smiled demurely and said, “I'm an engineer”

    An MIT surveyor once found the gates of Hell,

    The devil looked right back at him, and said, "Why visit me?
    You've been through Hell already; since you went to MIT"

    Elvis is a legend, he's the King of Rock \& Roll,

    Ace Towing roams the Cambridge streets each day and every night

    then towed away their towing truck, and now the Ace must pay!
    
    LTH was LTH when Crafoord was a pup
    and LTH will be LTH when Crafoord's time is up
    And any damn Economist who thinks he's in our class,
    can pucker up his rosy lips and kiss the moose's ass

    The firehose by day and forty beers by night,
    an engineer may never sleep but still be just as bright
    And should you ever ask him how he keeps up his routine,
    he'll raise his trusty can of JOLT, smile and say 'Caffeine!'
    
    Rapunzel let her hair down for two suitors down below,
