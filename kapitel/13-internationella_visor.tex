    Hooray and up she rises,
    Hooray and up she rises,
    Early in the morning!

    Put him in the longboat till he's sober…

    Pull out the plug and wet him all over…

    Put him in the scuppers with a hose-pipe on him…

    Heave him by the leg in a running bowline…

    Shave his belly with a rusty razor…

    Godiva was a lady who through Coventry did ride
    To show the royal villagers her fine and pure white hide
    The most observant man of all, an engineer of course,
    Was the only one who noticed that Godiva rode a horse
    
    We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the Engineers
    We can, we can, we can, we can, demolish forty beers
    Drink rum, drink rum, drink rum all day, and come along with us
    'Cause we don't give a damn for any old man who don't give a damn for us!
    
    She said, I've come a long, long way, and I will go as far
    With the man who takes me from this horse and leads me to a bar
    The men who took her from her steed and led her to a beer
    Were a bleary-eyed surveyor and a drunken engineer
    
    Caesar set out for Egypt at the age of fifty-three
    But Cleopatra's blood was warm, her heart was young and free
    And every night when Julius said good-night at three o'clock
    A Roman Engineer was waiting just around the block!
    
    The Army and the Navy went out to have some fun
    They went down to the taverns where the fiery liquors run
    But all they found were empties for the Engineers had come
    And traded all their instruments for gallon kegs of rum

    An artsman and an Engineer once found a gallon can
    Said the artsman: “Match me drink for drink, let's see if you're a man”
    They drank three drinks, the artsman fell, his face was turning green
    But the Engineer drank on and said, "It's only gasoline!"

    An Engineer once came to class drunk and very late
    He was carrying a load that you'd expect to ship by freight
    In fact, the only things there were that kept him on his course
    Were the boundary conditions and the Coriolis force
\end{parse lines}


    \colorbox{orange}{A physics man from M.I.T. went out and drank his fill,
    And then came to a strip joint 'cause he had some time to kill
    The motions that he witnessed there excited all his nerves,
    And he filled eleven napkins with equations of the curves}

    \colorbox{yellow}{3.141 is pi, and 2.7's e.
    The root of -1 is i, the speed of light is c.
    And I can rattle off these numbers 'til infinity,
    But the only thing that's constant is the work at MIT!}

    \colorbox{yellow}{Professors put demands on us, they say we have to tool,--
    But all we want to do is sleep, we hate this fucking school.--
    You can bitch or tell us off, even abuse us if you please,--
    But we're all set to graduate, and all we need are G's!--}

    \colorbox{yellow}{A man sat in a tavern with a lovely looking lass
    And stared when for the nineteenth time she raised and drank her glass
    "You've out-drunk four strong men, and half the bar my dear"
    The maiden smiled sweetly, said "I'm an Engineer!"}

    It happened once upon a girl whose eyes were full of fire
    Her physical endowments would have made your hands perspire
    To my surprise she told me that she had never been kissed 
    Her boyfriend was a tired Engineering scientist

    An MIT surveyor once found the gates of Hell,
    They looked the devil in the eye and said, "You're looking well."
    The devil looked right back at him, and said, "Why visit me?
    You've been through Hell already; since you went to MIT"

    My father peddles opium, my mother's on the dole
    My sister used to walk the streets but now she's on parole
    My brother runs a restaurant with bedrooms in the rear 
    But they don't even speak to me, 'cause I'm an Engineer

    Elvis is a legend, he's the King of Rock \& Roll,
    But the life that he was leading, well it finally took its toll,
    He realized, too late of course, he chose the wrong career,
    So he faked his death, came to Tech, now he's an Engineer.

    Now you should know by now we can demolish forty beers 
    And like all jolly fellas we drink our whiskeys clear
    We drink for every fellow who come from far and near
    'Cos he's a helluva-helluva-helluva-helluva helluvan Engineer

    Ace Towing roams the Cambridge streets each day and every night
    Towing cars and stowing cars to hide them out of sight
    They tried to tow Godiva's horse; the Engineers said, "Hey!"
    Then towed away their towing truck, and now the Ace must pay!
    
    LTH was LTH when Crafoord was a pup
    And MIT will be MIT when Crafoord's time is up
    And any damn Economist who thinks he's in our class
    Can pucker up his rosy lips and kiss the moose's ass

    The firehose by day and forty beers by night,
    An engineer may never sleep but still be just as bright,
    And should you ever ask him how he keeps up his routine,
    He'll raise his trusty can of JOLT, smile and say 'Caffeine!'
    
    Rapunzel let her hair down for two suitors down below,
    So one of them could grab a hold and give the old heave-ho
    The prince began to climb at once, but soon came out the worst,
    For the Engineer rode up a lift, and reached Rapunzel first
    
    Sir Francis Drake and all his ships set out for Calais Bay
    They'd heard the Spanish rum fleet was headed out that way
    But the Engineers had beat them, by a night and half a day,
    And though as drunk as ptarmigans, you could still hear them say:
    
    Venus was a statue made entirely of stone
    Without a stitch upon her she was naked as a bone
    On noticing she had no arms an Engineer discoursed
    "of course the damn thing's broken down - it should be reinforced!"


    If we would find an Economist within our sacred walls,
    We'll take him to the physics lab and amputate his balls
    And if he hollers "Uncle," I'll tell you what we'll do,
    We'll stuff his ass with broken glass, and seal it up with glue

    And should there be an Economist a-strolling our Great Court,
    We'll fetch a pail of lake Lake mud and make him drink a quart
    The water of the lake Lake can sure fix his every flaw,
    And the Engineers all drink it 'cuz it makes us what we are

    A graduate in chemistry went out to take a stroll
    Along the old dead lake Lake banks, where all the compounds roll
    That day he felt dejected at the bursting of a dream,
    For he couldn't find a trace of water in the stream

    We arr, we arr, we arr, we arr, we arr, we're Buccaneers
    We used to drink and plunder but we're run into a pier
    The only ones we've killed and realized we held them dear
    Was the islands only brewer and their lighthouse-engineer

    Late one night, an engineer was lost in work and toil,
    He set off to find a darling girl to help discharge his coil
    In no time at all he'd warmed her up, her resistance at a low...
    They fluxed until the morning's light, when their fuses, they did blow

    We saved our dough for years to send the kid to MIT
    Although we knew it was a place of wild depravity
    But now we know our kid is safe and we should have no fear
    He's never even heard of Sex 'cause he's an engineer
    
    An MIT computer man got drunk one fateful night
    He opened up the console and smashed everything in sight
    When they finally subdued him, the judge he stood before,
    Said, "Lock him up for twenty years, he's rotten to the core!"

    Godiva was a lady well-endowed, there was no doubt
    She never wore a stitch of clothes, just wound her hair about
    The first man who did make her was an Engineer of course,
    But on just one drink, an Artsie queer had made Godiva's horse
    
    A maiden and an Engineer were sitting in the park
    The Engineer was working on some research after dark
    His scientific method was a marvel to observe
    While his right hand wrote the figures, his left hand traced the curves
